# Preamble

Wherever injustice reigns, a remedy is needed to come to the aid of those oppressed by their impregnable governments.

The Russell Government proposes to constitute an informal recourse that aggregates the popular will around freely consented norms.

This declaration may be co-signed by any Human Being resident on Earth.

The Russell Government consists in co-founding the legitimacy of the people's self-determination.

It necessarily falls within the framework of the Human Rights of 1789 and the Charter of the United Nations.

**Its object is to declare regularly recommendations:u concerning the rights and legitimacy of individuals, organizations or popular movements.**

Moral adherence to these statutes confers legitimacy on all declamations.

If it determines what needs to be done, it does so in the belief that it is long overdue.

# Justice

Justice is achieved not just by repression, which must be symbolic, but by implementing measures that will prevent such crimes from being committed in the future.

This implies examining the causal chains and taking action on these causes.

The wrongs committed will only be truly righted when those at fault are brought face to face with their own conscience.

The culprits can then be called upon to work on repairing their damage, however degrading the task assigned to them may be.

Guilt can only be declared at the end of a Tribunal of Popular Opinion - a Russell Tribunal - which will take place by means of a ballot assessing the different levels of responsibility for the disasters under consideration. A second ballot will determine the penalties.

# Strategy

The Russell government is not bound by borders. Any individual may avail himself of the laws and recommendations of the Russell Government. Their legitimacy is based on their support.

Everyone is free to adhere or not to its recommendations, and thus to feel defended by the Russell Government.

The form of this government is suppletive. Its credibility, viability and respectability depend solely on acceptance of its recommendations.

Its premises are the right to self-determination, extended to the individual level. Self-determination is opposed to intrusion, falsification and dependence. It is the only guarantee of freedom to evolve and flourish, and this applies equally to an individual and to a people.

The Russell government enacts normative schemes, to which everyone is free to subscribe or not. By enacting these norms, the aim is to comfort those who are afraid to follow them because they feel alone, and who fear the tyrannical repression of failing institutions. They will be able to act "_In the name of the Russell Government_", with the support of its Community. By uttering these words, they will explicitly benefit from the legitimacy of their self-determination. They will be upholding the most insignificant laws of civilization, the UN Charter and Human Rights.

Under no circumstances will failure to comply with a new standard be considered an affront, an injustice, or justify the slightest reproach or repression, not even in a symbolic or contemptuous way. If a standard enacted by the Russell government is not followed, this will be deemed to determine that its relevance is insufficient.

This ability to refuse to accept norms that depend on everyone's understanding and approval builds the legitimacy of norms that are widely followed and applied.

As a result, political discussion will consist of debating ideas and arguments, not in an atmosphere of defiance and persuasion, but in an atmosphere of dispassionate search for the truth, whose consensus is based on clear, demonstrable concepts.

This, this functional procedure, and the freedom to adhere to it, is the foundation of Russell government.

Its implementation depends solely on the will of each individual and the justice of his or her arguments, and constitutes a bulwark against the tyranny of unjust laws enacted by irresponsible people drunk with power.

Every recommendation of the Russell government must be assumed in full conscience, and without any pressure, submission or hypocrisy.
