# Preamble

Wherever injustice reigns, a remedy is needed to come to the aid of those oppressed by their impregnable governments.

The Russell Government proposes to constitute an informal recourse that aggregates the popular will around freely consented norms.

This declaration may be co-signed by any Human Being resident on Earth.

The Russell Government consists in co-founding the legitimacy of the people's self-determination.

It necessarily falls within the framework of the Human Rights of 1789 and the Charter of the United Nations.

**Its object is to declare regularly recommendations:u concerning the rights and legitimacy of individuals, organizations or popular movements.**

Moral adherence to these statutes confers legitimacy on all declamations.

If it determines what needs to be done, it does so in the belief that it is long overdue.

# Justice

Justice is achieved not just by repression, which must be symbolic, but by implementing measures that will prevent such crimes from being committed in the future.

This implies examining the causal chains and taking action on these causes.

The wrongs committed will only be truly righted when those at fault are brought face to face with their own conscience.

The culprits can then be called upon to work on repairing their damage, however degrading the task assigned to them may be.

Guilt can only be declared at the end of a Tribunal of Popular Opinion - a Russell Tribunal - which will take place by means of a ballot assessing the different levels of responsibility for the disasters under consideration. A second ballot will determine the penalties.

# Strategy

The Russell government is not bound by borders. Any individual may avail himself of the laws and recommendations of the Russell Government. Their legitimacy is based on their support.

Everyone is free to adhere or not to its recommendations, and thus to feel defended by the Russell Government.

The form of this government is suppletive. Its credibility, viability and respectability depend solely on acceptance of its recommendations.

Its premises are the right to self-determination, extended to the individual level. Self-determination is opposed to intrusion, falsification and dependence. It is the only guarantee of freedom to evolve and flourish, and this applies equally to an individual and to a people.

The Russell government enacts normative schemes, to which everyone is free to subscribe or not. By enacting these norms, the aim is to comfort those who are afraid to follow them because they feel alone, and who fear the tyrannical repression of failing institutions. They will be able to act "_In the name of the Russell Government_", with the support of its Community. By uttering these words, they will explicitly benefit from the legitimacy of their self-determination. They will be upholding the most insignificant laws of civilization, the UN Charter and Human Rights.

Under no circumstances will failure to comply with a new standard be considered an affront, an injustice, or justify the slightest reproach or repression, not even in a symbolic or contemptuous way. If a standard enacted by the Russell government is not followed, this will be deemed to determine that its relevance is insufficient.

This ability to refuse to accept norms that depend on everyone's understanding and approval builds the legitimacy of norms that are widely followed and applied.

As a result, political discussion will consist of debating ideas and arguments, not in an atmosphere of defiance and persuasion, but in an atmosphere of dispassionate search for the truth, whose consensus is based on clear, demonstrable concepts.

This, this functional procedure, and the freedom to adhere to it, is the foundation of Russell government.

Its implementation depends solely on the will of each individual and the justice of his or her arguments, and constitutes a bulwark against the tyranny of unjust laws enacted by irresponsible people drunk with power.

Every recommendation of the Russell government must be assumed in full conscience, and without any pressure, submission or hypocrisy.

# Social organization

The world is being eaten away, phagocytized by an irrational and inconsistent desire for power, infecting minds at every level of society.

It's obvious that the impregnation of the subconscious and behavioral patterns of barbarism that has been slowly insinuated will not disappear overnight, and that it will take a long process of self-improvement to recover fair and effective moral standards.

In this sense, we all need to be aware that, unconsciously, we may be the owners of such destructive and irrational standards, whose reach lies in their natural predisposition to convince and organize persuasion strategies. Many of these behavioral patterns that constitute a lesion in the social network are deterministic impulses against which these people themselves cannot fight alone.

The value of decisions is measured by their impact on the social scale and on the fabric of inter-human relations. In this way, crimes have the value of their repercussions, just as decency, respect, openness and a willingness to listen to contradictory opinions have a positive and beneficial impact on these inter-human relationships.

What defines a civilization is certainly not just its individuals, but the nature of their relationships. A Russell government operates with this in mind.

# Responsibility

There is no magic answer to solve all society's problems, as drawn toward self-annihilation by the selfishness of individuals. However, there are elementary and inescapable rules that are effective.

**Human Rights** are at one and the same time a guide towards which we must strive, a beacon that serves as a landmark in the darkness, a gauge that enables us to assess the relevance of the situations created, and finally a yardstick of the viability of a human society. It is both a cause and a consequence, a reason and a hope. It's the Alpha and the Omega:u.

There is no question, for example, of making Human Rights conditional on any standards other than those derived from Human Rights.

Likewise, **the definition of freedom** must be requalified as being only that which is left to others. It implies the notion of civic responsibility. Freedom is not the right to do anything. Freedom is the result of what is left to free will. As such, it is the product of what each individual concedes, allows and leaves to others in terms of responsibility, both to themselves and to the common good.

Mankind's finest achievements are the result of slow emulation and a constant return to the study of the foundations and reasons for action, in order to better grasp the consequences. Reason functions in this way, constantly maintaining an intellectual dynamic capable of re-evaluating what exists through new understandings of nature and the laws of the universe. And all this with the hope, and leaving the door open to new generations, of doing better than we have been able to, while entrusting them with the care and responsibility of preserving and enriching the experience of their elders, namely ourselves.

We can't tell them what to do or think. This simple truth must make it clear that knowledge is portable, transmissible, belongs to everyone and rests on everyone, and that there is no functional reason to restrict it.

It is only possible, in this context, to admit its limits and give credence to each person's own judgment, so that they can forge their own conscience, and until reasons and logic are assimilated autonomously.

In such a paradigm, "survival of the fittest" means placing greater responsibility on the individual. His natural predispositions are not a cause of honorability. But the demand made on the latter is far greater: that of putting oneself entirely at the service of others, and helping them to progress.

# Loi

All the evils that plague this world can be resolved in a few decades, with a joint and determined effort by all, leading to a complete end to war, famine, pollution, and the existential threats that hang over our humanity like a sword of Damocles. This sanction that threatens us and of which we are the cause demands that we act with prudence and humility.

No law should be enacted without prudence and humility.

All laws must respect the criteria implicit in Human Rights, namely reciprocity and generalization.

Reciprocity:u is a principle of symmetry affirmed by the words of Jesus of Galilee when he said that "_Thou shalt not do what thou wouldst not have done_".

The principle of generalization:u consists in extending the principle of a law, or a practice, to everyone, so as to examine its correctness.

In this respect, we need to make the following crucial distinctions: there are three kinds of law:

- The laws of physics are inflexible and yet to be discovered. They are a source of enrichment for our understanding of the universe and a source of symbolic inspiration for our conduct.

- Biological laws are a second sphere of laws. They are dictated by Nature, but this time they are adaptive, reasonable, in the sense that they seem to be guided by a supreme intelligence. This is methodically observed under the term Harmony. So Nature, once again, is rich in teaching about the purpose of laws.

- Human laws are left totally free to our understanding. They cannot be confused with divine laws. They are merely publicly-agreed regulations enacted for the good of the people, according to a moral, logical, cultural and scientific level that is constantly evolving, and which we wish to see progress positively. The value of these laws or regulations is determined by their functionality and the extent of their consequences. A law without value is not respectable, and should not be respected. It follows from this that freely consented human laws cannot claim to be just, beyond the actual justice that results from their application. This means that the spirit of the law prevails over its wording, which, if applied literally, cannot claim to constitute any kind of justice. Freedom and responsibility dictate that human beings should be entrusted with the most correct interpretation of the law. Courts are there to settle disputes.

- Moral laws are ethical standards that emanate from all the preceding spheres. Their addition naturally tends to converge towards ethical standards, a number of which were explicitly laid down by Jesus of Galilee. Not that these norms are fixed in time and space; above all, they must be discovered gradually. They are only accessible through an intellectual and spiritual process. And yet, even without knowledge of them, they guide mankind in its difficult choices, and whisper in the ears of those who are willing to listen. Its spiritual and metaphysical dimension is undeniable, and its existence as a reality with weight in our decisions is equally undeniable.

The way out of this civilizational crisis is to objectively qualify the value of new laws. The enactment of just laws is the only way for humanity to survive the empirical discovery of the limitations of its beliefs and errors.

# Faith

Jesus of Galilee, the only one, enunciated with his righteous voice the elementary moral principles that vibrate as absolute truths, so that they might light humanity's path in the quest for self-realization. He never wished to command, but only to expose these truths, and pray to be heard. His deepest motivation, which imbued his subconscious, projected the divine design of a perfect society, whose members are Brothers to each other, and whose action is rational, understood, justified, and admired, not out of submission, but with enthusiasm.

We must not confuse Jesus with God, as is often done. Nor should we associate Jesus with the irresponsible practices of churches and their weak, fallible representatives. Nor should we pit Jesus against the various historical and cultural religions. His word and His will are those of the Union.

Jesus is the one of our brothers to whom we can turn with our thoughts, and whom we can love. God, on the other hand, is not a brother but a Father. The universe, us and Jesus are his creation. He alone knows the Why of all things, though we strive to acquire this knowledge through science, which he has left us for this purpose. He cannot be addressed, loved or personified, for he is independent of what he has created. What is infinite for us, is finite for Him. His intelligence and memory are infinite. He created love, thought, the structure of the universe and its sub-particles, biological mechanisms, DNA, relationships and all that we are discovering step by step thanks to Science, which He has left us for this purpose. But this entity, whose existence is only coldly logical, escapes our understanding. In this way, all we can do is love what he has created, and not the one who created it, for this has no resonance, for he has no exteriority. The only way to pay homage to Him is to love what He has created; not to love Him.

Jesus is the only time we'll ever know when God intervened directly and in person in human society on Earth. For the rest, He entrusts it to the laws He created, which are perfect.

# Progress

Those who oppress us, who kill en masse, defy the divine order thanks to a power acquired by chance, do not blame them. The infinite suffering they will endure in the next world will make them regret their actions. Even if they don't believe in it, they'll have to face up to the evidence of a divine order, and a divine sanction that's easy to guess and anticipate.

Those of our brothers who oppress us, deprive us of our lives, plunge us into misery and psychological suffering, and prevent us from finding the light, out of sheer cruelty, are nothing more than angry children equipped with overpowering weapons whose scope and operation they understand neither.

The point of the current situation, where madness is taking hold of humanity by focusing on anecdotal, irrational and neurotic issues, at a time when vital and urgent problems are rising up before us like a tsunami, is to unite people in a common determination, motivated by reason, conscience and pragmatism.

# Rationalization

It goes without saying that the terrible suffering endured by almost all human beings is due to the unjust distribution of wealth. A system based on the commodification of everything has exploited an individual desire for power to create the procedure that consists of constantly conditioning the satisfaction of needs through intermediate stages that interpose themselves, and keep increasing in quantity and complexity, ultimately making life on Earth impossible.

Solving all the world's problems comes down to solving the initial problem of satisfying basic needs, which could very happily be met if it weren't for these interstitial intermediaries.

We need to understand that they were created in the absence of any capacity to have a global vision of wealth, means and needs. Today, however, this is no longer the case, since we can have a complete overview of these data at a moment's notice, thanks to information technology.

This completely changes what can be done in terms of rationalizing the use of natural resources, since we can quantitatively estimate the usefulness and efficiency of the use of natural resources and human energy, in the pursuit of the common good.

This Common Good can be objectified by the satisfaction of everyone's needs, without making it conditional on any reason or "merit". In any case, in this society, it is only achieved by chance. The satisfaction of needs is an inalienable and imprescriptible right. Its denial constitutes a violation of human rights and an obstacle to the evolution of humanity. This reality is blatantly obvious at a time when, precisely, what humanity needs most is to evolve.

It is therefore possible to statistically estimate the needs of each individual, and to provide for these needs, immediately and unconditionally. The implementation of the means to do this will follow mechanically from this will.

# Infrastructure

The question of money is that of justifying a transaction. The term transaction comes from the old world, where contracts are made between two autonomous entities, regardless of any questioning of their impact on the rest of society. Freedom of contract, on the other hand, is based on freedom of possession. And this freedom of possession, in the name of preserving "what is one's own", has slipped into the hands of legal entities to the detriment of physical persons, producing the opposite effect which is dispossession:u, including of what was free and abundant. Mankind has made a terrible mistake, the consequences of which, when proven, are fatal for everyone.

So the question that remains, that of justifying the allocation of wealth, must be addressed by a new, functional mechanism. The reason for authorizing these transfers is the pursuit of the Common Good. The "payments" must be made "in kind", and constitute in themselves the reason for these payments. In other words, to put it plainly, transfers of goods are not conditioned by laws and workings, but are themselves laws and workings. To put it even more clearly: THEY ARE RIGHTS. **Needs automatically give rise to rights**.

The birth of numbers and mathematics in the history of mankind was motivated by the desire to administer wealth rationally, so that it would be distributed equitably and produce a sense of fairness for everyone. It's important to return to these fundamentals, and not get lost on the way to saying that justice depends on numbers, and these numbers depend on the people who count, while their unconscious depends on their personal, selfish interests.

Rather than estimating the value of everything, inert or living, material or intellectual, transferable or immovable, on a half-numerical line running from zero to infinity, with a single scale of measurement, it would be more appropriate and judicious to estimate them according to their use value, which falls under a greater level of complexity, i.e. an algorithm.

Proposal ::u

It will then be necessary to create the discernments that enable us to make comparable what is comparable, by measuring the evaluation criteria specific to each of the objects of the negotiations. In this way, it should no longer be possible to compare the value of natural resources, humans and the goods produced by these humans, in order to make exchanges, and end up converting humans into mere commodities.

The following valuation criteria are mutually incompatible:
- Natural resources and large-scale structures, which are part of the global commons and their long-term management,
- Human labor, which depends on the skill and effort of each individual, and corresponds to what a civilization wants to devote its energy to,
- Goods and services provided on a small scale and in the short term, to meet individual needs.

A "separation of church and state" must take place. Here, we are talking about **a separation of values**. The creation of new discernments, which increase the complexity and finesse of judgments, is always to everyone's advantage.

These three poles must be articulated in such a way that each contributes to the good of the other two, and that by working on a small scale, the human being has the conviction, then the proof, that his work benefits _in fine_ everyone on a global scale. This is the foundation of motivation at work, and this motivation is the foundation of the will to live and of human genius.

With such an infrastructure, which determines precisely, explicitly, rationally and objectively how these three axes can be articulated together, use value need only be determined by the impact of any activity on the health of the overall system.

# System

A company is a system. A system is an operation. An operation is determined by its components and its goals. Without establishing rational and concrete goals, an operation cannot be called a System, and this pseudo-system can only correctly lead a civilization to its downfall. And this Logic is deterministic, although it incorporates diffuse notions such as Morality and Justice, which must be discovered step by step. That's why a civilization is never perfect, but can always tend towards greater harmony.

A system has intrinsic properties. Basically, part of its energy is devoted to its operation, part to its maintenance, and part to its mutation.

Another intrinsic property of any system is its emergence. What results is worth more than the sum of its parts, provided they function harmoniously. Emergence is what results from the system, and it is here that the goals of a human society must be situated.

Finally, one of the main properties of a system is that if one of its components fails, the whole structure risks failing in turn. So, every part or sub-part of a system is equally important.

The spirit in which a civilization rationally oriented towards concrete evolutionary goals must operate can be none other than that of seeking the common good. To this extent, the good of the Society has almost the same value as our faith in the universe.

# Goals

It may be speculated that God did not give life to humans to see them suffer needlessly and maim one another. But it is undeniable that a civilization is functional in the long term if and only if it progresses, and that to do so, human Genius must be motivated by transcendence.

The current state of this civilization, and Earth, and at this time, indicates that most human energy is wasted on a heavy, difficult and complicated daily routine, with the main result of barely achieving daily subsistence, and with no hope of improvement in the future. On the contrary, indicators show a general scarcity of all natural resources, which are wasted and thrown into the sea.

Solving structural problems and striving for greater efficiency can only free up the time and means for human beings to devote themselves to their personal and spiritual development, in order to create the conditions for a substantial improvement in their own future.

These two ends of the same problem are the cause of each other. It's a question of seeking positive emulation, and entering a virtuous circle.

If human rights are implemented, a prolific future is possible. The pursuit of happiness, personal fulfillment and the satisfaction of curiosity are the indispensable goals of human rights, and vice versa.

So, the means to achieve peace and sustainability must be focused on concrete objectives. It's a question of rendering unnecessary the evils that govern this world, such as wars, poverty, the quest for power, and the waste of resources.

Only a system that makes humans a necessary and valuable cog in the wheel can be considered viable.

Proposals:u

A world in which rights depend on means gives rise to the idea of conceiving a world in which means depend on rights.

With this in mind:
- The justification of transactions must be a collegial decision;
- All vital needs must be satisfied, and the rest devoted to major projects;
- No human being should be placed above others by futile personal ambition;
- No action by a person or a country should harm others;
- The needs of every human being must be met in an equitable manner commensurate with existing and available wealth.
- When progress is to be made, it must benefit all, without distinction and inalienably.

Without special power and selfish personal gain, those currently in power may be more inclined to live a simple, quiet life, while those who feel within themselves a real and powerful desire to contribute to the good of all, will have more scope for action.

# L'Univers

The structure of the universe teaches us how it was conceived.

The deterministic laws of physics are inflexible, drawing, to a first approximation, a predictable destiny, in which case humans are of no importance or interest. From this restricted logic comes chaos theory, saying that, in the end, chance is the only master, that nothing matters and that morality doesn't exist. These people claim that Jesus is a mystification.

But biological laws teach us that an organism whose DNA predetermines its characteristics is capable of adapting to its environment and evolving positively in order to **conform with it a true harmony**.

In the same way, moral laws, for those who want to hear them, guide the free choices of human beings so that they can measure the consequences of their actions, and repent if necessary, in order to learn from them, which they will make sure to pass on to new generations.

**Freedom is what breaks with the determinism of the universe**, without which it would effectively be no more than a fatal and useless design. But the information at the end of the universe is greater than that which was present at its beginning.

This freedom is God's main gift to human beings, so that they can be compenetrated with this universe, and become responsible for and co-creators of it. Humans are therefore responsible to God for the choice of their actions.

For this reason, freedom is the universe's greatest asset. It must always be maximized, insofar as is reasonable, possible and logical. Only Jesus enjoyed a freedom that can be considered absolute.

Freedom means involvement, responsibility, conscience, reason, and perfect agreement with the divine design for the creation of the universe. All these criteria, or whatever they are called, justify the divine work. Nothing more can be said, nothing more can be forced to be believed; we can only observe empirically that the maximization of freedom constitutes a providential increase in reason, logic, and therefore peace and justice. Everything is linked, and freedom is the backbone.

# ER

The second and third greatest riches of the universe, after freedom, are humus and drinking water:
- **Humus** is the starting point of the living chain, and is only present on thirty centimeters of the Earth's surface.
- **Drinking water**, in quantities barely sufficient for all, is unfortunately highly contaminated, and must be protected as a matter of the utmost priority.

Similarly, the **DNA** of all living organisms, including humans, must be protected with the utmost severity. A creation whose complexity totally escapes us must not be altered in a frivolous and inconsistent manner.

Food production methods must be revised, abandoning prescriptive agriculture in favor of agroforestry permaculture, which consists of using natural forces to create forests for the benefit of diversified food production with nutritious qualities, and which have the advantage of being sustainable by fertilizing the earth and creating humus.

War devices:b] must be abandoned immediately. Armies to be converted into humanitarian armies (with no hidden agenda).

All **natural resources** must be placed under the global jurisdiction of a democratic and scientific governance:u, whose members are disinterested, numerous, complementary, and with short, non-renewable mandates.

Politicians responsible for any crime must be returned to civilian life, or imprisoned where appropriate. **The whole system of governance must be overhauled**, and competencies and skills scrupulously monitored.

A true **democratic system** must be established, where questions cannot be decided by science. It must faithfully transcribe the majority judgment of the masses. In turn, it must have honest and exhaustive information.

**Education** is the first source of security. Every individual must be offered, at his request, the general and specialized instruction he desires.

Everyone's **health** must benefit unconditionally and fully from all acquired knowledge and techniques.

# Synthesis

The Russell Government's recommendations can be intelligently adapted to specific situations. They express principles for improving the quality of human relations and life in society.

All political decisions taken on behalf of those they represent should demonstrate that this decision corresponds to the public determination.

The challenge of the coming-of-age of Earth's civilization, at the dawn of its opening onto the universe, is to certify once and for all, and to engrave in the marble of the collective unconscious, the principles of self-determination, self-sufficiency, maximization of freedom, protection of the weak, and research into and application of moral standards universally shared by all civilizations.

# Signature

All persons agreeing to any of these terms are free to consider themselves under the jurisdiction of the ‚Ñùussell Government.
